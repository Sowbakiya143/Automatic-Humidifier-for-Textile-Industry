Objective:

To maintain optimal humidity in the textile industry automatically, improving fabric quality, reducing yarn breakage, and preventing static electricity.

Description:

This project uses a DHT11 sensor to measure humidity and temperature in real-time. The ESP8266 microcontroller processes the data and controls a mist generator via a relay to maintain the desired humidity. A gas sensor ensures air safety, while an OLED display shows real-time humidity and temperature. The system is integrated with Blynk, allowing remote monitoring and control through a smartphone.

By automating humidity control, the system reduces manual intervention, enhances fabric quality, and protects machinery in textile operations.
